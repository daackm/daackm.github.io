Dave Ackmann of the Gateway Division of the NMRA (St Louis, Missouri) offers his clinics to other NMRA Divisions via virtual conferencing
(ZOOM and other systems).  The links below show "trailers" describing the content of his clinics in 90 seconds or less.
All clinics include a handout, which can be found on Dave's web site, at <A href=http://daackm.github.io> http://daackm.github.io</a>.
