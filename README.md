I am Dave Ackmann of Florissant Missouri in the USA. I am a member of the Gateway Division of the National Model Railroad Association and an occasional clinician at the local, regional and national level. My educational background is in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.
This repository contains files associated with my HO Scale model railroad, the Baden, Vogt & DeSmet. The repository was created in January, 2020, and is expected to host code associated with animation effects using microprocessors, such as the Arduino, along with other model railroad documentation. It is my hope that these files, used in conjunction with my videos on YouTube (search for "Ackmann Trains Baden Vogt DeSmet") will inspire you to try new ideas in model railroading.
