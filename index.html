Welcome</B></font>
<Font face=arial> to my Web site!  <BR>I am Dave Ackmann from Florissant Missouri, USA. I am a Model Railroader and member
of the Gateway Division of the National Model Railroad Association.  I teach clinics on a variety of Model Railroading
topics, primarily in the area of modeling technology.  Below are links to the clinics I have presented since 2019,
and you are invited to take a look.  These clinics have all appeared virtually on the NMRAx web site, and I also conduct
them for NMRA Divisions upon request, at no charge.  If you have any questions, or would like to host me as a clinician for your NMRA
Division, just
<a href="mailto:ackmanns@charter.net?subject=Model Railroading Question or Clinic Request&body=If interested in a clinic for your NMRA
%20Division or Region, please include your name, telephone number, and the proposed clinic date, time and your time zone,
%20along with your NMRA Division or Region name and the topic that interests you.  Thanks for your interest.">

<font face=arial color=red><B>Automating CAD for Model Railroad Structures Using "Generators"</B>
</font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<br>





<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>

When it comes to modeling structures for your model railroad, many basic structures are made from common "primitive" items
like walls, roofing and windows. 3D printing makes
the creation of common structural objects easier and more precise than traditional, manual methods, but learning how to use Computer Aided Design software
to create custom designed structures can be really difficult.  In this clinic Dave Ackmann presents
how he developed computer programs he calls "Generators" to design such objects (and many more), allowing him to specify
design parameters through a simple form and then automatically calculate a precise 3D model to his specifications, all without
having to devote hours upon hours learning to use a sophisticated CAD package; <B>best of all, the programs are available for free.</B>
Plus, you no longer need the manual dexterity of a video gamer to create many custom 3D structure models!

<BR>
 </font>
<BR>
Normally at this point in the description of one of Dave's clinics you would have the opportunity to view a brief video "trailer" to introduce the clinic.
But for this particular clinic, it is better to first show you a screen shot of the user interface for one of the Generators, in this case
the Generator which creates shake shingles..

The user just enters design parameters such as height and width (and others as the user becomes more sophisticated),
and then presses the green button.
The Generator calculates a design file containing the appropriate 3D instructions
for the free "OpenSCAD" application.  The user then launches OpenSCAD, imports the programming instructions created by the Generator into OpenSCAD.
and saves the file in Stereo Lithography (STL) file
format, suitable for direct 3D printing or to be used as the basis for
derivative designs.

<BR>&nbsp; <BR>

<BR>

<BR>&nbsp; <BR>And here is a sample of the resulting model.  Roofing panels are normally created individually and then
duplicated, reversed and joined with a second panel.  Here we see a pair joined at
an angle representative of something that might be used for an A-Frame cottage.

<br>&nbsp; <br><B>TinkerCAD Basics</b> - Creating enhanced, derivative designs from Generator primitive items,
                    such as punching holes for windows and doors in a Basic Building, is really simple, and to learn how
                    I suggest the use of a free and very simple CAD package, TinkerCAD. By <b>investing 6 minutes</B> in this video, you will
                    quickly and painlessly (at least as painless as a COVID 19 injection) learn
                    the first 9 things you need to know to use <u>any</u> CAD software, in this case, TinkerCAD;
                    trust me, it is a skill set worth learning and well worth your time and attention.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Second Section</b>
                    <a href=https://youtu.be/WeNG-cGQf98 >

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Handout</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; To view the Handout,
                    <a href=https://github.com/daackm/daackm.github.io/blob/master/AutomatingCADHandout.pdf
                    type='application.pdf' target='_self'>
                    click here</a>. For some unknown reason the text on the first page may not
                    appear in some browsers.  If this is your case, just click on the DOWNLOAD button on the right
                    and the complete two page document will display.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>New for  December 2024</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; One by one, all Generators are being enhanced to include "Click On"
documentation of the function of each input field.  If you wonder what a field does, just click on its name to the left
of the value box, and an explanation will appear in the "NOTES" area in the upper right of the input form.  Sometimes the NOTES
will also contain brief hints and how to avoid common "GOTCHAs".  So check to see when a Generator was last updated, and if it was updated after
01DEC24, give this new documentation feature a try.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Also new is a column in the table for "Tips & Tricks".  Here you will find short videos about how I leverage Generators in TinkerCAD
to create interesting objects.
If something looks interesting, give the entry a Click!  Not all Generators will have an entry,
but hopefully these brief videos will leverage the value of Generators as you learn how they can be combined with TinkerCAD
to create objects you might not have thought you could do.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
FINALLY, I am getting around to producing Tutorials on some of the most popular Generators.  Each of these will be about 5 to 7 minutes
long, and show at least one example of what each field does.  Creating tutorials is time consuming, and about one a month is my limit,
so the interval between new Generators.
and enhancements to older ones may increase.  But it needs doing, so stay tuned; look for the first of
these. "Basic Buildings", to appear before the end of 2024.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>



<B>Downloading the Generators: </B>
<Font color=red face=arial><B>When you <a <a href="https://github.com/daackm/daackm.github.io/blob/master/AutomatingCAD.zip" download> click here</a>,
you can download a ZIP file that contains the current version of every Generator.
To complete the download, click on the "Download" button (

<img src="DownloadIcon.jpg"  >

) toward the lower right of the next window.
When you do so, a .ZIP file will appear in your download folder; you can double-click on the archive
to open it and execute an individual file directly or extract the entire collection.
But be advised that the first time you try to run the program, Windows Virus Checker (Windows Defender) may flag the file as suspicious, and you may
not be able to run it unless you click "More Info" and "Run Anyway"  For your own piece of mind,
I suggest you virus scan the file to convince yourself it is virus free.  If you like what you see, extract the file from the ZIP Archive and
store it on your local hard drive.  Enjoy!

</font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
For a 3D printing Newbie, using 3D design software can be a bit intimidating, so let's simplify things and
start learning Computer Aided Design with software we may already know,
namely PowerPoint, and a technique I call 2 and-a-Half D CAD.
You will learn how to use advanced PowerPoint drawing tools like bezier curve manipulation and shape subtraction to create useful 2D shapes,
including board-and-batten siding, clapboard siding, corrugated roofing, windows, fences, railings, sign supports
and more. We will cover how to export PowerPoint pages as PDFs, and convert the PDFs into Stereo Lithography files for 3D printing using the ANYCONV.COM.
web site.  Finally, we will cover just a few simple object manipulation tricks in TinkerCAD and CURA to manipulate simple objects into more complex ones.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Downloadable Objects</B> If you have seen my clinic on "Building Billboards for the Baden Vogt & DeSmet"
      you learned how to create billboard support structures from styrene.  You can also create the legs, boardwalk and frame
      using the 2 and-a-Half D technique.
      Here are links to 5 different PowerPoint files you can use to create framed billboards with artwork
      8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 feet tall in HO scale (which means that the images you draw or download from the web
      must be 1.10" 1.38", 1.65", 1.93" or 2.20" tall, respectively).  It's up to you to
      cut your own backer board from sheet styrene (such as Evergreen 9030 or 9040), to cut cut a strip of 8210 styrene as
      the back support strip that connects the legs together, and to size the horizontal frame segments to suit your artwork.
      Once you click on a size, click on the DOWNLOAD button to open the model in PowerPoint.

<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic is an entry level clinic
covering what I have learned in the first few months of developing 3D models and printing them on my Ender 3 Pro
3D printer.  I also cover how I downloaded models from other model railroaders.  Transferring images from PowerPoint
and creating 3 dimensional Heralds will also be covered.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Troubleshooting Guide</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting type='application.pdf' target='_self'>
This site from Simplify3D is an excellent guide for
help in troubleshooting many 3D printer problems.</a>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Skirts, Brims and Rafts - What's the difference?</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I generally don't use skirts, brims or rafts to hold my designs to my 3D printer build plate; I try
to place a large, flat surface on the bottom and keep the build plate clean and level.
But when I do need better surface adhesion, I generally use brims
<a href=https://www.simplify3d.com/support/articles/rafts-skirts-and-brims/ target='_self'>.
Click on this link for a good explanation of the differences.</a>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Good sites for 3D Models:</B> In addition to Thingiverse.com which I really like for structures
(when you get there search for "HO Scale"), 3dwarehouse,sketchup.com which I like for pickup and commercial trucks
and TurboSquid.com
(all of which I mention in my clinic as good web sites to find 3D Models). I recently was impressed with Free3d.com; not all their
models are free, but they do have some nice cars and dinosaurs.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Sizing Motor Vehicles</B> When I used to take a 3D model of a motor vehicle into a slicer and try to resize it for HO scale,
I never felt comfortable that I was getting the size right.  What did I do?  I measured my existing commercially purchased cars and trucks.
I found that a 53' trailer is 4.4" long (112mm), a mid-century sedan is 2.1" long (53mm) and a covered stake truck is 3.33" long (84mm).
The trailer and the stake truck are about 1.12" wide (28mm), the sedan 0.78" (20mm).  A small delivery truck will be between
0.975" and 1.06"  wide (25-27mm) and as long as that long sedan.  More recent automobiles will be a bit shorter.  Now when I import a .STL file into .
CURA, especially when importing from 3DWarehouse, the first thing I do is click on the object, and then click on the
resize tool on the left edge of the CURA window.  I then specify the appropriate width of the vehicle, and I have a starting point.
I think widths are a better indicator than lengths.  Now if I can just get the supports right!.

<font face=arial color=red><B>Amazing Arduino Animations </B></font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic was first presented in July, 2020 at the Gateway-X virtual convention of the NMRA,
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
It is organized into Chapters, and takes you from the basic concepts to procuring
components and simple programming of Arduino microprocessors. It then expands on different
components that can be added to Arduinos to provide sound, lighting and motion effects.
Each Chapter contains a PDF with detailed explanation of the topic, and may contain
one or more Arduino programs (or "sketches" as they are called in Arduino-speak), and
sometimes references to videos or other useful learning experiences.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
The Projects build on the Chapters and show how to create vignettes of action
to bring life to your model railroad.  Projects always include written instructions,
a video, and sketches that can be copied and used immediately, even if you have
no formal education in electronics or computer science.
<BR>  &nbsp;<BR>
All you need to do is click on a link below to open a topic of interest.

<font face=arial color=red><B>Building Billboards on the Baden, Vogt & DeSmet </B></font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic was first presented at the Gateway Division of the NMRA in July, 2019, and subsequently at
Trainfest 2019, Gateway-x 2020, and later presented virtually at several NMRA Division meetings.
It instructs the viewer on how to make custom billboards, as implemented on the Baden,
Vogt & DeSmet HO scale model railroad.  The clinic describes where to get billboard images and how to build the support structures.
It recommends standardizing billboard heights, and descibes how to make assembly fixtures out of
Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene and a router table.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
Each part is a video, ranging from 3 minutes to 18 minutes.  I hope you find them useful and enjoyable.

<font face=arial  color=green><B>Gateway Division AP Electrical Engineering Working Group: </B></font>
In November, 2021, I became the AP Chairman for the Gateway Division of the NMRA (St Louis and surrounding area).
I am personally interested in the Electrical Engineering Certificate, and challenged our attendees to join me,
with the goal of submitting our SOQ (Statement Of Qualification) by the end of June, 2022.  To that goal,
I have created a web page with a simplified perspective of the requirements and helpful ideas for achieving our goal.
If you are interested in viewing this page.
<a href="Electrical.html"> click here</a>.
I think the single most valuable thing you can do to achieve this certificate is to ignore the requirements on
the NMRA web site and focus on the SOQ, particularly the first three sections.  Decide which options you
want to pursue, complete the engineering and document your work.  Because of COVID-19, we may need to find
ways to verify the work, and I am working with the Region on how to do so,  Creating the engineering drawings required
in sections 4 and 5 will also be a learning experience, but I think my group is up to it,  Interested?  Drop me
and email with the link at the top of the page.

<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR> A sequel to "Amazing Arduino Animations", this clinic will present more animations for model railroading, many of which
utilize the control and synchronization features of Arduino Microprocessors.  This clinic has an anticipated release date of Summer of 2022.

<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>I have discovered software that lets me
design and 3D print model railroad figures that are posed in positions not available commercially.
The figures are designed on a computer and the programs are far from simple, but
where there is a strong enough will, this is a way.

<font face=arial  color=brown><B>3D Printing a Model Railroad Herald</B></font> - A Sample Technique for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
<font face=arial color=brown>This potential clinic would show how I create two-colored freelance model railroad heralds on a simple
3D printer (Ender 3 Pro) to decorate my layout room.
I use TinkerCAD to draw the underlaying "field", and then superimpose a rim, images and text transferred from PowerPoint.
I use CURA for a slicer, and before printing I add a line to the CURA preferences to allow for printing in separate layers and colors.
It's fun, and not that hard.

<font face=arial  color=brown><B>The View from the Cab</B></font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
<font face=arial color=brown>Did you know you can use a tiny video camera to record what it looks like from the cab,
as we ride the rails around our layout?
This clinic shows how an inexpensive camera can be used to record video to a SD card and how a different camera can broadcast over
a wireless network.  The cameras range from $10 to $55.  The view is different from the cab.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
</font>.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>


<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<font face=arial  color=brown><B>Other Stuff I Like:</B></font>
<br> Starting in November, 2021, I began investigating using CAD programs for layout design.  I remembered that ATLAS had track planning
software and quickly learned that ATLAS was basically reselling a package called SCARM.  Since they were the same price, I visited the
SCARM site at <a href=https://www.scarm.info/index.php>https://www.scarm.info/index.php</a> and downloaded the free version.  It's a neat little tool.  I
also visited the YouTube site for "DIY and DIGITAL RR" <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/DIYDigitalRailroad> (click here)</a>
for a nice tutorial on using SCARM <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqnCTd_stS0&t=1593s>
(click here for tutorial)</a>.
<br>&nbsp; <BR>

I don't envision creating a clinic on the topic, but if you are interested in getting started in CAD for layout design, give
SCARM and Jimmy's clinic a try.  The free version has a limit on the number of components you can include in your design, but if you buy
the $39.99 version of the software, the limit is removed.  Additionally, I downloaded the "Model Train Simulator" (MTS) which allows me to
run virtual trains on my PC screen.
<BR>&nbsp; <BR>

I liked running the Model Train Simulator, and just for grins I created John Allen's "Timesaver" layout in SCARM and downloaded it to my web site.
If you download the trial versions of SCARM and MTS, you can
<A href=https://github.com/daackm/daackm.github.io/blob/master/Timesaver.scarm type='application.pdf' target='_self'>click here</a>
to download my implementation.  When you open SCARM, do a FILE/OPEN on my Timesaver.  Then click on the TRAIN CONTROLLER in the upper right, turn on the
Power, set the direction of the red locomotive and bump the throttle. See how many moves it takes to be eastbound on the track on the upper right
with all cars on tow!

<br>&nbsp; <br>


Subsequently I decided another piece of software might be better for me, and eventually chose ANYRAIL at
<a href=http://www.anyrail6.com>http://www.anyrail.com</a>, as I felt it handled flex track better.  I liked Ron Marsh's
<A href=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ronstrainsandthings+anyrail>tutorials on YouTube</a>.  I ponied up $59.99 for the
complete version, which allows me to have more than 50 objects in the design.
