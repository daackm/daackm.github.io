This clinic was scheduled to be presented at the 2020 National Convention
of the National Model Railroad Association, which was cancelled due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, but here it is, on-line, and ready for you to view and enjoy.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
The clinic is organized into Chapters, and takes you from the basic concepts to procuring
components and simple programming of Arduino microprocessors. It then expands on different
components that can be added to Arduinos to provide sound, lighting and motion effects.
Each Chapter contains a PDF with detailed explanation of the topic, and may contain
one or more Arduino programs (or "sketches" as they are called in Arduino-speak), and
sometimes references to videos or other useful learning experiences.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
The Projects build on the Chapters and show how to create vignettes of action
to bring life to your model railroad.  Projects always include written instructions,
a video, and sketches that can be copied and used immediately, even if you have
no formal education in electronics or computer science.
