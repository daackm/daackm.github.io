Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic will be presented at the September 26, 2020 NMRAx virtual conference, available through Facebook and YouTube.
It is an entry level clinic
covering what I have learned in the first few months of developing 3D models and printing them on my Ender 3 Pro
3D printer.  I will also cover how I downloaded models from other model railroaders.  Transferring images from PowerPoint
and creating 3 dimensional Heralds will also be covered.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Skirts, Brims and Rafts - What's the difference?</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I generally don't use skirts, brims or rafts to hold my designs to my 3D printer build plate; I try
to place a large, flat surface on the bottom and keep the build plate clean and level.
But when I do need better surface adhesion, I generally use brims

<font face=arial size-18 color=red><B>Amazing Arduino Animations </B></font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic was scheduled to be presented at the 2020 National Convention
of the National Model Railroad Association, which was cancelled due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, but here it is, on-line, and ready for you to view and enjoy.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
The clinic is organized into Chapters, and takes you from the basic concepts to procuring
components and simple programming of Arduino microprocessors. It then expands on different
components that can be added to Arduinos to provide sound, lighting and motion effects.
Each Chapter contains a PDF with detailed explanation of the topic, and may contain
one or more Arduino programs (or "sketches" as they are called in Arduino-speak), and
sometimes references to videos or other useful learning experiences.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
The Projects build on the Chapters and show how to create vignettes of action
to bring life to your model railroad.  Projects always include written instructions,
a video, and sketches that can be copied and used immediately, even if you have
no formal education in electronics or computer science.

Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic instructs the viewer on how to make custom billboards, as implemented on the Baden,
Vogt & DeSmet HO scale model railroad.  It was first presented at the Gateway Division of the NMRA (St Louis) in the summer of 2019,
and subsequently at Trainfest 2019.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
Each part is a video, ranging from 3 minutes to 18 minutes.  I hope you find them useful and enjoyable.
