Welcome</B></font>
<Font face=arial> to my Web site!  <BR>I am Dave Ackmann from Florissant Missouri, USA. I am a Model Railroader and member
of the Gateway Division of the National Model Railroad Association.  I teach clinics on a variety of Model Railroading
topics, primarily in the area of modeling technology.  Below are links to the clinics I have presented since 2019,
and you are invited to take a look.  These clinics have all appeared virtually on the NMRAx web site, and I also conduct
them for NMRA Divisions upon request, at no charge.  If you have any questions, or would like to host me as a clinician for your NMRA
Division, just
<a href="mailto:ackmanns@charter.net?subject=Model Railroading Question or Clinic Request&body=If interested in a clinic for your NMRA

<font face=arial color=red><B>2 and-a-Half D CAD Using PowerPoint</B>
</font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
For a 3D printing Newbie, using 3D design software can be a bit intimidating, so let's simplify things and
start learning Computer Aided Design with software we may already know,
namely PowerPoint, and a technique I call 2 and-a-Half D CAD.
You will learn how to use advanced PowerPoint drawing tools like bezier curve manipulation and shape subtraction to create useful 2D shapes,
including board-and-batten siding, clapboard siding, corrugated roofing, windows, fences, railings, sign supports
and more. We will cover how to export PowerPoint pages as PDFs, and convert the PDFs into Stereo Lithography files for 3D printing using the ANYCONV.COM.
web site.  Finally, we will cover just a few simple object manipulation tricks in TinkerCAD and CURA to manipulate simple objects into more complex ones.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Downloadable Objects</B> If you have seen my clinic on "Building Billboards for the Baden Vogt & DeSmet"
      you learned how to create billboard support structures from styrene.  You can also create the legs, boardwalk and frame
      using the 2 and-a-Half D technique.
      Here are links to 5 different PowerPoint files you can use to create framed billboards with artwork
      8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 feet tall in HO scale (which means that the images you draw or download from the web
      must be 1.10" 1.38", 1.65", 1.93" or 2.20" tall, respectively).  It's up to you to
      cut your own backer board from sheet styrene (such as Evergreen 9030 or 9040), to cut cut a strip of 8210 styrene as
      the back support strip that connects the legs together, and to size the horizontal frame segments to suit your artwork.
      Once you click on a size, click on the DOWNLOAD button to open the model in PowerPoint.

<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic is an entry level clinic
covering what I have learned in the first few months of developing 3D models and printing them on my Ender 3 Pro
3D printer.  I also cover how I downloaded models from other model railroaders.  Transferring images from PowerPoint
and creating 3 dimensional Heralds will also be covered.

This site from Simplify3D is an excellent guide for
help in troubleshooting many 3D printer problems.</a>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Skirts, Brims and Rafts - What's the difference?</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I generally don't use skirts, brims or rafts to hold my designs to my 3D printer build plate; I try
to place a large, flat surface on the bottom and keep the build plate clean and level.
But when I do need better surface adhesion, I generally use brims
<a href=https://www.simplify3d.com/support/articles/rafts-skirts-and-brims/ target='_self'>.
Click on this link for a good explanation of the differences.</a>

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Good sites for 3D Models:</B> In addition to Thingiverse.com which I really like for structures
(when you get there search for "HO Scale"), 3dwarehouse,sketchup.com which I like for pickup and commercial trucks
and TurboSquid.com
(all of which I mention in my clinic as good web sites to find 3D Models). I recently was impressed with Free3d.com; not all their
models are free, but they do have some nice cars and dinosaurs.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Sizing Motor Vehicles</B> When I used to take a 3D model of a motor vehicle into a slicer and try to resize it for HO scale,
I never felt comfortable that I was getting the size right.  What did I do?  I measured my existing commercially purchased cars and trucks.
I found that a 53' trailer is 4.4" long (112mm), a mid-century sedan is 2.1" long (53mm) and a covered stake truck is 3.33" long (84mm).
The trailer and the stake truck are about 1.12" wide (28mm), the sedan 0.78" (20mm).  A small delivery truck will be between
0.975" and 1.06"  wide (25-27mm) and as long as that long sedan.  More recent automobiles will be a bit shorter.  Now when I import a .STL file into .
CURA, especially when importing from 3DWarehouse, the first thing I do is click on the object, and then click on the
resize tool on the left edge of the CURA window.  I then specify the appropriate width of the vehicle, and I have a starting point.
I think widths are a better indicator than lengths.  Now if I can just get the supports right!.

<font face=arial color=red><B>Amazing Arduino Animations </B></font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic was first presented in July, 2020 at the Gateway-x virtual convention of the NMRA,
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
It is organized into Chapters, and takes you from the basic concepts to procuring
components and simple programming of Arduino microprocessors. It then expands on different
components that can be added to Arduinos to provide sound, lighting and motion effects.
Each Chapter contains a PDF with detailed explanation of the topic, and may contain
one or more Arduino programs (or "sketches" as they are called in Arduino-speak), and
sometimes references to videos or other useful learning experiences.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
The Projects build on the Chapters and show how to create vignettes of action
to bring life to your model railroad.  Projects always include written instructions,
a video, and sketches that can be copied and used immediately, even if you have
no formal education in electronics or computer science.

<font face=arial color=red><B>Building Billboards on the Baden, Vogt & DeSmet </B></font> - A Clinic for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This clinic was first presented at the Gateway Division of the NMRA in July, 2019, and subsequently at
Trainfest 2019, Gateway-x 2020, and later presented virtually at several NMRA Division meetings.
It instructs the viewer on how to make custom billboards, as implemented on the Baden,
Vogt & DeSmet HO scale model railroad.  The clinic describes where to get billboard images and how to build the support structures.
It recommends standardizing billboard heights, and descibes how to make assembly fixtures out of
Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene and a router table.
<BR> &nbsp;<BR>
Each part is a video, ranging from 3 minutes to 18 minutes.  I hope you find them useful and enjoyable.

<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>I have discovered software that lets me
design and 3D print model railroad figures that are posed in positions not available commercially.
The figures are designed on a computer and the programs are far from simple, but
where there is a strong enough will, this is a way.

<font face=arial  color=brown><B>3D Printing a Model Railroad Herald</B></font> - A Sample Technique for Model Railroaders
<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
<font face=arial color=brown>This potential clinic would show how I create two-colored freelance model railroad heralds on a simple
3D printer (Ender 3 Pro) to decorate my layout room.
I use TinkerCAD to draw the underlaying "field", and then superimpose a rim, images and text transferred from PowerPoint.
I use CURA for a slicer, and before printing I add a line to the CURA preferences to allow for printing in separate layers and colors.
It's fun, and not that hard.

<BR>
Dave Ackmann
<BR>
Gateway Division, NMRA
<BR>&nbsp<BR>
<font face=arial color=brown>Did you know you can use a tiny video camera to record what it looks like from the cab,
as we ride the rails around our layout?
This clinic shows how an inexpensive camera can be used to record video to a SD card and how a different camera can broadcast over
a wireless network.  The cameras range from $10 to $55.  The view is different from the cab.
