<BR>&nbsp<BR>
This group was formed in November, 2021 to assist NMRA members in completing the requirements for the NMRA Electrical Engineering
AP Certificate.  Our committment to eash other is to assist ourselves in submitting the Statement Of Qualifications (SOQ)
by the end of June, 2022.

This section of the web site will list resources that Dave Ackmann, chair of the AP Program for the Gateway Division and moderator of the Group,
has found useful.
Enjoy!

<br>&nbsp; </br><font face=arial color=green>Requirements in a Nutshell: </font></b>

The requirements for the AP Electrical Engineering Certificate are available on NMRA.ORG, and at first glance are quite intimidating.
But if you look at the SOQ and how much of the requirements are optional, it begins to look
more manageable.  Of course, the requirements at the web site govern, but the KISS rule applies.

<br>&nbsp; </br><font face=arial color=green>A Clinic: Proof it can be done: </font></b>
In 2019 at the Liberty Bell regional convention, a presentation was made on how to wire a model railroad which would meet the requirements of
Sections A and B.  They did so in under 2 hours, but the presentation is condensed into 25 minutes.  The first 3.5 minutes show the layout coming together
mechanically in stop motion, and the remainder of the video show the wiring and proof of operation.  They use snap-track for simplicity of assembly.
Although the video is available at the NMRA web site, you may

to see it as well.  Login credentials will be required.

<br>&nbsp; </br><font face=arial color=green>DC or DCC</font></b>
The requirements for the Electrical Engineering AP Certificate were written mainly in the Direct Current (DC) era of model railroading,
but a lot has happened since then, mainly Digital Command Control (DCC).  The requirements can be satisfied either way, or even with a hybrid approach.
A lot of the documentation at the NMRA.ORG web site is oriented to DC and "Double Pole Double Throw" switches, but if you are into DCC,
you probably have made a lot of this work already.  This section will address some of the ways Electrical Engineering is done with DCC.

<br>&nbsp; </br><font face=arial color=green>The Engineering Drawing</font></b>For me, the hardest thing appears to be creating the engineering
drawing of the propulsion circuitry for my layout.  My basement layout is.about 22 by 22 feet in my basement, and while it runs well, there is a lot of detail
in documenting the gaps and electrical attachments.  I am considering starting from scratch with an "N" Scale layout on a
2 by 4 foot sheet of plywood and demonstrating my Achievements on it, and I may do so for portability and demonstration at future clinics.
HOWEVER, I did the deed, measure the plywood and drew the surface in PowerPoint.  But PowerPoint is not the tool to draw the track.  I did try SCARM
software (and its clone software from Atlas), but found it rather difficult to use.  I am now trying to use ANYRAIL6 software, and I think
it is more promising.  Both programs have free trial versions, and complete licenses (which allow your layout to be larger than 50 componente)
are available for $39 and $59 respectively.  I thing they are going to be worth the price.  BTW, Ron March, Superintendent of the Turkey Creek
Subdivision in Kansus City has a good

YouTube tutorial on ANYRAIL6</a>.




<br>&nbsp; </br><font face=arial color=green>Documentation</font></b>
In this era of COVID19, it may be difficult to get together and demonstrate that we have met the requirements.  This secion is a work
in progress, but I hope to demonstrate how the use of a camera or cell phone to record our accomplishments can be used to document our
work satisfactorily.  But documentation is not only showing what we have done, but claiming our work on the Statement Of Qualification, or "SOQ".
If you haven't done so already, download the SOQ in PDF form by
<a href=https://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/education/achievement/pdf/2019_soq_electrical.pdf>clicking here.</A><BR>
or in Microsoft Word Format by
<a href="https://www.nmra.org/sites/default/files/education/achievement/doc/2019_soq_electrical.doc">clicking here.</a><BR>
If you have MS Word, I suggest the latter, because you can modify the file to check off the options you wish to use for your certification,
and perhaps color code the check boxes in red to indicate options you intend to take, and then change the colors to green when
you have completed the task.
